# Open Sesame
Open Sesame's purpose is simple: to prevent garage doors from excessively remaining open.

## Backend
The backend is an express.js server that executes BACnet commands needed to do a couple things:

1. Trigger garage door open/close
2. Retrieve status as to whether the door is open or closed
